\section{Step 9: Super duper advanced ideas}

Got this far? Congrats! Here are a few ideas to sharpen your Dart point.

\begin{itemize}
\item Add simple formatting when displaying the message. Parse messages, look for words wrapped with asterix¡Çs, and bold those words when displayed in the chat window. You might find Dart¡Çs Regular Expressions27 helpful here.
\begin{itemize}
\item For example, if a user types "*Dart is rad!!*" you should display "Dart is rad!!"
\end{itemize}
\item Store the username into the browser¡Çs Local Storage and load it up when the client appstarts. The Local Storage interface28 will be useful.
\end{itemize}
