\section{Step 1: Set up your environment}

Dart offers better productivity through powerful and helpful tools. At the center of the toolchain is the Dart Editor, a lightweight text editor that understands how to analyze, run, and debug Dart apps. The editor works with the Dart SDK and Dartium (a build of Chromium with the Dart VM) to give you an integrated experience.
