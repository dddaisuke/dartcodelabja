\section{Step 7: Send and receive data with WebSockets}

WebSockets25 are part of the HTML5 family of technologies. They enable bi-directional full-duplex communication between a modern web browser and a WebSocket server. WebSockets can stream discrete messages, either text or binary data.

WebSockets are more efficient than long polling or constant querying over HTTP. They are ideal for chat applications! :)

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Learn about WebSockets
\item Connect to a WebSocket server
\item Receive data from a WebSocket
\item Send data to a WebSocket
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Code}

If you need to catch up, you can copy step07 onto start-here for this portion of the codelab.

\subsection{Walkthrough}

Open client/chat-client.dart and find the ChatConnection class. You will now add a WebSocket connection, listen for messages, and send messages.

Tip: Open the API docs for the WebSocket class at http://api.dartlang.org/html/WebSocket.html.

\subsubsection{Connect to the WebSocket server}

Add a new instance field for the WebSocket to the ChatConnection class.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
class ChatConnection {
// Step 7. Add webSocket instance field.
WebSocket webSocket;
String url;
ChatConnection(this.url) {
\end{verbatim}

When the WebSocket instance is instantiated, it attempts to connect to the server at the URL. Find \_init inside of ChatConnection and add the following code.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
_init() {
// Step 7. Connect to the WebSocket, listen for events.
chatWindow.displayNotice("Connecting to Web socket");
webSocket = new WebSocket(url);
\end{verbatim}

First, the code displays a message to the chat window indicating that it's attempting a connection to the WebSocket server. Second, it instantiates a new WebSocket object, which attempts to connect to the WebSocket server.

Use the Open Declaration feature of the editor to determine where the url variable comes from.

Notice how the url variable is an instance variable of ChatConnection, originally set in the constructor.

\subsubsection{Handle WebSocket events}

WebSocket objects respond to four events: open, close, error, and message. The message event is fired when a new message is received on the WebSocket. The content of the message is found in event.data.

Tip: Open the API docs for the WebSocket events at http://api.dartlang.org/html/
WebSocketEvents.html.

Handle the four WebSocket events inside of ChatConnection's \_init.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
_init() {
// Step 7. Connect to the WebSocket, listen for events.
chatWindow.displayNotice("Connecting to Web socket");
webSocket = new WebSocket(url);
webSocket.on.open.add((e) {
chatWindow.displayNotice('Connected');
});
webSocket.on.close.add((e) {
chatWindow.displayNotice('web socket closed');
});
webSocket.on.error.add((e) {
chatWindow.displayNotice("Error connecting to ws");
});
webSocket.on.message.add((e) {
print('received message ${e.data}');
});
}
\end{verbatim}

Now that the event listeners for WebSocket events are configured, you are ready to use the \_receivedEncodedMessage() method you created from Step 5.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
webSocket.on.message.add((e) {
print('received message ${e.data}');
_receivedEncodedMessage(e.data);
});
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Send messages to the WebSocket server}

Finally, with the webSocket instance connected, you can send messages to the server. Find \_sendEncodedMessage() in the ChatConnection class and send the encoded message to the WebSocket server. Only send the message if the webSocket object exists and is actually connected to the server.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
_sendEncodedMessage(String encodedMessage) {
// Step 7. Send the message over the WebSocket.
if (webSocket != null && webSocket.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) {
webSocket.send(encodedMessage);
} else {
print('WebSocket not connected, message $encodedMessage not sent');
}
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Test the app}

Everything should be wired up, time to test your app!

Run the chat-server.dart, if not already running (see Step 2 for instructions). Next, run the client/chat-client.dart application, which launches Dartium. The chat window will print [system]: Connected if the client connects to the WebSocket server.

[Image]

Check the chat-server.dart output in the Dart Editor to see "new ws conn message", which confirms your client has connected to the WebSocket server.

Not connecting to the server? Make sure the chat-server.dart is running. Sometimes, completely shutting down and restarting Dartium helps.
Send some messages! Copy the URL in Dartium, open a new Dartium tab, and paste the URL in. Enter a different username, and start chatting between the two windows.

\subsection{Advanced}

Handle connection failures by retrying the connection attempt. Add increasing back-off retry delays.

Update the \_init() method to take a number of seconds to wait before retrying the connection. Add a boolean to track if an error was encountered (you will use this shortly).

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
_init([int retrySeconds = 2]) {
// Step 6
bool encounteredError = false;
\end{verbatim}

In both the close and error event handlers, add a retry to reconnect after a delay. Set the encounteredError boolean to true so the retry timer is scheduled only once, in the event that both close and error events are fired.

\begin{verbatim}
// client/chat-client.dart
webSocket.on.close.add((e) {
chatWindow.displayNotice('web socket closed, retrying in $retrySeconds
seconds');
if (!encounteredError) {
window.setTimeout(() => _init(retrySeconds*2), 1000*retrySeconds);
}
encounteredError = true;
});
webSocket.on.error.add((e) {
chatWindow.displayNotice("Error connecting to ws");
if (!encounteredError) {
window.setTimeout(() => _init(retrySeconds*2), 1000*retrySeconds);
}
encounteredError = true;
});
\end{verbatim}

The setTimeout() method takes two arguments: a function and when it should be called (in milliseconds from now). In this case, the \_init() method runs after retrySeconds. This is a good example of Dartâ€™s lexical closures, because the inline function for setTimeout() easily references both \_init() and retrySeconds.
